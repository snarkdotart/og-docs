# Trait Generator

Trait Generator is a piece of JavaScript code that gets invoked for making tokens evolve. Trait generator defines, what traits and properties the token will have.

Trait generator defines for each NFT:

- *Traits*: Visible to public in metadata, on marketplaces.
- *Properties*: Not visible, internal data storage.

Trait generator also decides, if a new generation should be created.

You can learn how Trait Generator works in this boilerplate repository:
